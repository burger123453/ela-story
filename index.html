    <h3>story down here:</h3>
    <p>1.ordinary world (starting place)</p>
        <p>kumo woke up and was having an ordinary day. he smelt something
    delicious in the air...</p>
        <p>he sniffed the air some more and followed a trail to find the smell.
        carlo (the cat that isn't miso) came with him.</p>
    
    <p>2.call to adventure (story part of how it happens)</p>
        <p>kumo goes outside and carlo follows. they go on an adventure to
    find where that tasty smell is coming from.</p>
    
    <p>3.entering the unknown (new world that hero experiences)</p>
        <p>kumo needed to go pee, so he went to a tree. but plot twist the
    tree was a monster!!! the tree monster slashes at kumo and he gets
    blasted back! carlo swipes at the tree and its leaves fall off. the tree,
    in shock, runs away into the forest</p>
        <p>kumo continues to smell the air and follow the trail...</p>
        <p>he finds a healing bag/kit object and uses his kumo intellect to
    fix his wounds with it.</p>
        <p>then he continues to trying to find the smell that grows stronger
    every second.</p>
    
    <p>4.mentor/allies; helpers/aid (people that help character)</p>
        <p>along the way, kumo meets a tree that didn't attack him and it said,
    "kumoooo *ghostly sounds* there is a dangerous path ahead to the
    object you seek..... you can only defeat it by..."</p>
        <p>and then the tree voice disappeared.</p>
        <p>kumo, perplexed by the words that he didn't know, made a confused
    dog sound and continued on his journey.
    carlo was like meow meow and followed kumo</p>
    
    <p>5.road of trials (obstactles hero faces)</p>
        <p>kumo continued on his journey and found a fountain that was
    spewing water.</p>
        <p>he tried to drink from it, but it was a trap! kumo fell down a hole
    and carlo was still at the top, distracted by some random flying thing in
    the sky.</p>
        <p>kumo slowly walked around the tunnel.</p>
        <p>there were a lot of bones and empty pet food bowls!</p>
        <p>he reached the end to find a magical blockage wall that
    blocked his path</p>
        <p>he contacted carlo with a device that he definitely had the whole
    time and asked him for help</p>
        <p>carlo came over to above where kumo was and there was a puzzle.</p>
        <p>in the puzzle there was 2 dog toys and 1 cat toy. carlo chose the
    cat toy and the floor rumbled. carlo fell down onto the other side of
    the blockage. there was a button which opened the door, allowing kumo to
    pass. they reached the light of the tunnel and went back up to the surface.</p>
    
    <p>6.supreme ordeal</p>
        <p>just like the tree voice said from before, a dangerous monster
    emerged from the bushes. there was a big angry water-breathing cat! it must
    have been mad that carlo took the cat toy! it squirted some water at carlo's
    face, temporarily blinding him. kumo tried to fight back, but the cat was
    too powerful...</p>
        <p>but then the tree voice came back and was a person which was how
    it was speaking! it helped make the cat more drowsy by saying,
    "GO TO SLEEP"</p>
        <p>but the cat shook it off. it came back even madder. kumo and the
    tree voice person helped stall it while carlo went back to the tunnel.</p>
        <p>in there, carlo grabbed the cat toy and went running back to them.</p>
        <p>carlo threw it with his mouth as high as he could for it to reach
    the cat.</p>
        <p>when the cat got its toy back, it started to get more calm and
    went back into the forest.</p>
        <p>the tree voice left to go somewhere while kumo and carlo continued
    their journey.</p>
        <p>kumo smelt the air again and the smell was stronger. they must
    have been nearby to the treat.</p>
    
    <p>7.last part (what happens when hero come back from journey)</p>
        <p>kumo finally found the treat which was a cake. but plot twist again
    and the cake was a lie (gasps). the cake was secretly a trap and kumo fell
    down a never-ending pit...</p>
        <p>then kumo woke up back at home and realized that there was no cake
    and it was all a dream. or was it??.....</p>
    <h2>the end</h2>
